## Pre-launch Journey

… Our journey began in 2003 when the company took on the massive challenge of creating an Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Financial Markets. After 2.5 years of living and breathing for 18⁄7 days in total isolation, imbedded in heavy mathematics, engineering, esoteric approaches and ultimately divine insight, the Artificial Intelligence was born. Through this medium, the first brick in the path to founding a revolution in technology’s interaction with humankind, heralded and given expression to the tagline:

> ‘Uniting the gift of technology with the heart of humanity’

### 2005 - Artificial Intelligence

… Artificial Intelligence (AI) established for code optimisations to bring a real-time FOREX analysis market system and reduce boot time by 50%. AI seamlessly decodified the complexities of underlying mass emotional and psychological approaches used in trading.

Artificial Intelligence further augmented any trading system by projecting forward the optimum price to buy/sell based on the time of the trader’s trading decision. Overall result would be ~10% greater profits to any applied trading system.

### 2008 - National Australian Testing Authority (NATA)

… Redux and compact the Artificial Intelligence applied to the challenging situation of continuously drifting 3 Phase Power Meter Calibrations to solve the question: At what point is a meter out of calibration from the normal aging process? Solution was embraced by NATA.

### 2011 - Smart Metering @ PowerCor

… PowerCor is one of the 5 selections to implement the replacement of all electricity meters in the entire State of Victoria. GreenField environment, operating in the early Internet of Things (IoT) space with $300 million total project budget and only 5 people across all companies in the Australian Energy distribution sector selected.

All underlying technology needed to be reliable, vendor agnostic and financially sound. While not in the Artificial Intelligence space, a deep understanding of the potential as well as application of Internet of Things to the coming world, was essential. The thoroughness of the technological investigation required a hands-on, 6-week partnership with the vendor SilverSpring Networks.

### 2011 - IoT Take Two, Mobile Gaming

… What does a handheld device really do? How do humans best interact with and accept a hand-held devise as part of their daily lives? Can Artificial Intelligence be used to serve humankind? These and many other questions plagued at the root of technological clarity. And so Ahasai Designs, an early incarnation of Taylored Technology was created.

Major achievements centred around speed of delivery and to rebuild a graphics’ engine enabling what industrial peers considered impossible at the time. Dynamic Pointlighting on an iPad 2. (Something that we all take for granted these days)

### 2012 - Horoo (Qantas Group)

… Advancement requires sacrifice, and a journey into the far reaches of back-end systems. Ruby was the language of vogue in Melbourne, and performance optimisation of web systems was essential. Pivotal in introducing Splunk into the company, deep data analysis skills enabled discovery of profit leaks in the customer conversion funnel.

First opensource DevOps tool was also released, allowing PCI & PII Compliant synchronization of Production Data Models against Development database schemas. Saving ~30min of development time per agile story.

### 2013 - Web2.0 GTLD

… Take the internet apart and you end up with two primary services: Email & DNS. Without them everything becomes nothing. So why not build a framework that empowers developers to build upon and removes the boundaries in communication between testers & developers? That’s exactly what we did, and it was used for the next 5 years (that we know of) our company ensured that Australian & managed Subsidiaries of the new GTLD domain names were fast, accurate and effective in serving their relevant DNS entries.

### 2014 - Big Data Warehousing

… In an era when everyone was struggling with identifying the line of demarcation between Data & Big Data, analytics, data quality and wide pipes became normal talking terms. The $16 million project with CGU Insurance (part of Insurance Australia Group) centralised and streamed every piece of decentralised customer information collected from 1970 to present (from a still running 1970 mainframe). We standardised communication between teams and began the journey of introducing more powerful analytics and business intelligence tools into the relevant departments. Consulted on the usability and challenges interfacing with the business streams for CGU’s first Mobile Application.

## Taylored Technology’s Product Journey

### 2014 - WordPress @ LightSpeed

… Armed with a thorough understanding of human interactions with technology, built a platform - a cloud mechanism exercise in efficiency.

…  a growing ecosystem of applications used in harmony to succeed in business. (Yes it still applies today) This platform with 100+ plugins, enables these services, all updated on different release cycles under constant threat of hacking and attack. Written the application on 160,000+ lines of code with the optimiser unable to keep everything in memory.

The largest WordPress hosting companies used the same approach of a larger hammer if the server is struggling, then make it bigger and cache where possible. Ultimately the hammer wouldn’t be able to keep up with the demand.

We flipped this world upside down by using tiny servers, tonnes of them, to decentralise dependencies and ensure up-time maintenance and traffic scalability. Avoided restrictions of any plugins required by customers. We gained speeds 20x faster than our competitors, then pulled WordPress apart at the core and raised the performance to 50x faster than our competitors. We lived on the edge of technology in this ecosystem and thrived serving 2.5Billion un-cached & dynamic unique pageviews a month per site.

- Were seen on Australian TV Channels: 10, Eleven, & One
- Used containerization for everything, adopting Docker a month after its initial release

### 2015 - Enterprise & Mobiles

… Entered the Enterprise Market and liaised with clients throughout Asia Pacific such as:

- CIMB (Malaysia)
- NTT Docomo (Japan)
- NTT Data (Sapporo Japan)
- IBM (Japan)
- Acrodea (Japan)
- National Australia Bank (Australia)
- ING Direct (Australia)
- (Non-Exhaustive List)

Moved away from the Small to Medium Enterprise focus and passed the implementation of our infrastructure technology and clients to trusting sources.<Paste>

### 2016 - Return to AI as Machine Learning

… Google and Microsoft heavily promote Machine Learning as a solution to many of the undiscovered problems in Information Technology & Business. The world at large was catching up, becoming ready for a re-introduction of Artificial Intelligence.

Delved deep into the darker side of customer marketing, identifying the fine line between helping customers and invading their privacy. Developed Machine Learning Algorithms for

- Anonymous Identification of website visitors, tracking across multiple devices with rapid marketing demographic segmentation
- Multi-Channel marketing attribution pipelines able to identify exactly what assets should be boosted for optimum customer conversion with fiscal efficiencies and baselines
- Market driven content aging. Machine learning identifies the exact content to consume on social media and the appropriate time to retired it, avoid content recycling.
- Real time streaming data for Machine Learning

### 2017 Resurfacing Containerization

… Infrastructure is the backbone to development, covering each step - from a Developer’s first decision that code is ready for release until the customer shares their experience with the void. Infrastructure is the silent hulking behemoth ensuring everything moves, has its place in the world and shifts and changes to front and center of the software development lifecycle

Our primary focus is to be cloud native, cloud agnostic, but not ignorant, outperforming others in all the major areas of cost, efficiency speed and reliability.
