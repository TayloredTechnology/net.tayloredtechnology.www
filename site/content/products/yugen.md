## Purpose

… foundation for building auto-documenting & testable cloud microservices / functions & nanoservices in a serverless environment

## Why create it

… The world is suffering from rapid adoption at the cost of quality movement, where fundamental shifts in approaches to developing software are starting to occur. The mantra of monolithic services or tightly coupled services is fading away and being replaced by often (multiple) microservices to achieve the same task at a fraction of the cost.

Many of these are open source, and the number of endpoints that any microservice needs to integrate, verify and keep current with these days is rapidly becoming staggering, the traditional approach of unit / integration / end to end testing is unable to keep up with this new landscape.

>**Yūgen** is a foundational approach to keep up with this shifting landscape by providing a methodology for developing serverless functions to create highly integratible microservices with a strong focuses on future driven best practices.
