> Agnostic & Recyclable Containerization Deployments

## Purpose

… Self orchestration for applications on any underlying containerization infrastructure. If you don't know your application requirements, Concourse will make an educated guess based on your development language

## Why create it

… Infrastructure must be agnostic from applications. Unfortunately after years of searching there wasn't an approach that allowed this to be a reality. Each approach ultimately locks a client into a specific vendor with great effort to move away from them.

*Concourse* was born to change this, to create a shift in how the Information Technology community approaches deployment and CI/CD systems.

Fundamentally *Concourse* is to Deployment Pipelines what Kanban is to Agile. In Deployment Pipelines items are pushed through the pipe until they appear in production with multiple gates or gatekeepers along the path. Conductor uses a Pull approach where items are automatically progressed when ready.

Its a subtle change in logic, but empowers high quality application principles and makes 12 Factor simpler to manage.

But that's not all it was designed to do, *Concourse* truly is what its name means

> an open space where roads or paths meet

All software can pass through *Concourse* and orchestrate itself. Yes, no more is it necessary to develop software, then partner with infrastructure and figure out your software requirements that are unknown then develop templates to deploy into xyz infrastructure or container orchestrator.

If you know, you tell *concourse*, if you don't then it will make an educated guess.
