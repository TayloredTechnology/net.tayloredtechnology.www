      <description>Project Information Our client(s) wanted to expand the user personalization approach to websites to accelerate conversions and increase return on their marketing campaigns. There were already a world of tools available for interacting, understanding and optimizing conversion flows for known or logged in users, but its a green-field environment for anonymous users ‘if’ its possible to identify, track and categorize their interactions into a demographic &amp;amp; segment rapidly.
Business Transformation Prior to our involvement the primary method of interacting with ‘anonymous’ users was to subscribe to a large multi-geographical service (such as Facebook or Google) that the ‘anonymous’ user would already be logged into that’s prepared to share non PII (Personally Identifiable Information) with the company.</description>
